## Description

The Tech Blog is a Content Management System (CMS)-style blog site where developers can publish articles, blog posts, and thoughts related to technology. Users can create accounts, log in, create, update, and delete their blog posts, comment on other users' posts, and more.

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and uses Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for the database, and express-session for authentication.
